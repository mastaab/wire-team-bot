# Wire Team Bot

**This is a proof of concept to demonstrate the power of the Wire JS SDK through an AI team assistant.**
Wire Team Bot uses large language models (LLMs) to recognise decisions and commitments in team
conversation, extract structured records, answer questions and generate catch-up summaries.
The official `@wireapp/wire-apps-js-sdk` supplies encrypted messaging, structured mentions,
native replies and reactions. This application supplies the AI integration, storage and workflow logic.

**Release: [Wire Team Bot 1.0](https://github.com/adamlow-wire/wire-team-bot/releases/tag/v1.0.0).**
The default Compose stack uses `ghcr.io/adamlow-wire/wire-team-bot:1.0.0`.

This README covers capabilities, setup and operation. [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) tracks architecture,
validation evidence and release progress. [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) contains contributor guidance.

## What the AI does

The bot calls separately configured model services. The repository contains prompts, retrieval,
validation and application code; the bot image does not include model weights or train a model
on your team's messages. Operators choose the models and run inference locally or through a
hosted endpoint that supports the request format used by this application.

| Capability | How it works |
|---|---|
| Passive capture | In ACTIVE conversations, a model classifies incoming ambient messages. Selected messages and recent context go to an extractor, which proposes decisions, actions, completions and related structured information. Application code validates and saves accepted changes. |
| Questions | Models interpret the question and compose an answer using recent conversation and relevant stored records retrieved from the current channel. Retrieval does not extend across channels in this pilot. |
| Catch-up summaries | A model summarises stored decisions, actions and activity signals. A catch-up request can reuse a stored summary. |
| Optional semantic retrieval | An embedding model converts text into vectors to find related records by meaning and support similarity/contradiction checks. Embeddings are disabled in the current staging candidate; chat-model features still run. |
| Explicit commands | Recognised commands such as `decision: …`, `action: …`, `ACT-0001 done`, `my actions`, reminders and privacy controls use application code to perform the operation without a chat-model call. Free-form variants may take the AI question or extraction path. |

For example, an unmentioned `I'll send the checklist tomorrow` can produce an AI-extracted
action and a 📝 reaction. `ACT-0001 done` uses a deterministic update path. Asking
`What am I responsible for?` uses models and retrieved records to compose an answer. The Q&A
path has no write tools: an answer suggesting a command is not confirmation that it ran.

Extraction and generated answers can miss or misinterpret information. The application checks
model output, identities, scope and state transitions before writes, but those checks do not
make every extracted fact or answer correct. Inspect the saved records and use their IDs for
corrections. A new model/provider configuration needs its own quality evaluation; passing
results for one configuration do not establish the quality of another.

### What data reaches the models

**AI processing can happen without mentioning the bot while a conversation is ACTIVE.**
Depending on the operation, prompts can include the triggering message or question, recent
message text and speaker names, channel purpose, member names/IDs, and relevant stored
records. Extraction uses a 30-message window; Q&A has a separate recent-message buffer
(default 50). Enabled embeddings also send the text being embedded to the configured provider.
Explicit commands can become later conversation context or stored records used by a model.

Wire Team Bot is an authorised Wire participant and receives decrypted messages. Wire's
end-to-end encryption covers delivery to that participant; onward requests to model services
are a separate data path. All enabled model endpoints—chat and embeddings—must be local to keep inference on-premises. Provider retention and use of submitted data depend on that provider
and deployment, not this repository.

The application's extract-and-forget design keeps raw surrounding conversation in bounded
in-memory buffers and persists structured records, source references, summaries and audits.
Those records can contain sensitive information. PAUSED/SECURE controls stop new message
processing and clear transient buffers; they do not erase existing records or retract requests
already sent to a provider. The SDK also keeps local crypto/session state. See
[PLAN.md](PLAN.md#3-current-delivery-state) for safeguards, observed evidence and remaining
privacy-validation limits; this is not a blanket guarantee about every storage layer or provider.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose v2
- A linux/x86_64 host. The Wire SDK's CoreCrypto native library needs glibc 2.38 or newer, which the
  `node:22-trixie-slim` image provides. It does not run on Alpine (musl) or on linux/arm64.
- A Wire **application** registered by a team admin, with its app token (`WIRE_SDK_API_TOKEN`). This is not a user login.
- A configured OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint, plus an embedding endpoint if vector features are enabled

### 1. Clone and configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adamlow-wire/wire-team-bot.git
cd wire-team-bot
git checkout v1.0.0
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env using the template: Wire credentials, crypto key, model endpoint and model slots
openssl rand -hex 32   # paste as WIRE_SDK_CRYPTO_KEY
```

Configure a reachable chat endpoint and model names before starting. The bot image does not
start a model server or download models. With Docker, `localhost` in an endpoint URL refers to
the bot container; use an address reachable from that container. For the pilot setup, disable
embeddings unless a compatible embedding service is configured (see [Model configuration](#model-configuration)).

### 2. Start the stack

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 3. Add the app to a Wire conversation

A team admin adds the Wire Team Bot app to the designated test conversation first. The greeting explains how to save a purpose using an explicit `context:` command.

---

## Testing against the Wire staging backend

Everything below runs from a dev box with Docker. The image is built locally, so the host's glibc does not matter.

1. **Register Wire Team Bot as a Wire app** (needs a staging team account with admin/owner rights; the backend checks the
   `CreateApp` team permission). The token is the `zuid` cookie the backend hands back; the script checks it against
   `/access` before writing anything.

   ```bash
   node scripts/register-app.mjs versions --host https://staging-nginz-https.zinfra.io          # sanity: API v15+ available
   node scripts/register-app.mjs create   --host https://staging-nginz-https.zinfra.io \
        --email <team-admin@staging> --name "Wire Team Bot (staging)" --out .env.staging
   ```

   You are prompted for the admin password (never echoed). If the account has a second factor enabled, run
   `send-code` first and pass `--code`. `.env.staging` is written with mode 0600 and is gitignored. It contains
   `WIRE_SDK_API_HOST`, `WIRE_SDK_APP_ID`, `WIRE_SDK_APP_DOMAIN`, `WIRE_SDK_API_TOKEN`, and a freshly generated
   `WIRE_SDK_CRYPTO_KEY`.

2. **Add the model endpoint, API key, model slots and embedding mode** from [.env.example](.env.example) to `.env.staging`. Use the exact keys in the template and [config.ts](src/app/config.ts); copying different names will not configure the application.

3. **Start the staging stack** (own container names, volumes, and Postgres port 5433, so it coexists with a production stack):

   ```bash
   npm run staging:up
   npm run staging:logs        # expect migrations, member-cache hydration and Wire client connected
   ```

4. **Add the app to a conversation** as a team admin in the staging Wire client. Wire Team Bot greets and asks for the
   channel purpose. Then try `decision: ship it`, `@Wire Team Bot what did we decide?`, `remind me in 2 minutes to test`.

5. **Restart test**: find the bot container with `docker compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml ps`,
   then run `docker restart <bot-container-name>`. Send another message and verify decryption and
   member names. Retain the existing crypto key and storage volume.

6. **Token expired or revoked?** Mint a new one without creating a new identity, then restart:

   ```bash
   node scripts/register-app.mjs refresh --host https://staging-nginz-https.zinfra.io \
        --email <team-admin@staging> --app-id <WIRE_SDK_APP_ID> --print-token
   ```

   Keep the existing `WIRE_SDK_CRYPTO_KEY` and volume; only `WIRE_SDK_API_TOKEN` changes.

`npm run staging:down` stops the stack while retaining its volumes. Do not remove the database
or crypto volumes during QA or ordinary restarts.

## Environment variables

### Wire application (all required)

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `WIRE_SDK_API_TOKEN` | App authentication token minted by a team admin for the Wire Team Bot application |
| `WIRE_SDK_API_HOST` | Wire backend API base URL (e.g. `https://prod-nginz-https.wire.com`) |
| `WIRE_SDK_APP_ID` | Wire UUID of the application; verified against the backend at startup |
| `WIRE_SDK_APP_DOMAIN` | Wire federation domain of the application (e.g. `wire.example.com`) |
| `WIRE_SDK_CRYPTO_KEY` | 32 random bytes, hex-encoded (64 chars), protecting the local CoreCrypto keystore. Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`. Losing it means losing all E2EE state. |

The SDK stores its SQLite database and keystore under `./storage` relative to the process working directory
(`/app/storage` in the container, backed by the persistent volume declared in the Compose file).

### Database

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgres://wirebot:wirebot@localhost:5432/wire_team_bot` | PostgreSQL (with pgvector) connection string. The docker-compose stack overrides this to `postgres:5432` automatically. |

### Upgrading an existing deployment after the naming cleanup

Model configuration now uses the `WIRE_TEAM_BOT_` prefix. Rename each previous model key to
that prefix, retaining its suffix and value, including primary/fallback models, API settings,
embedding mode/dimensions and evaluator overrides. Compare with [.env.example](.env.example)
and [config.ts](src/app/config.ts); do not rotate Wire credentials or the crypto key.
The old environment prefix and former plain-text bot-name alias are no longer supported.
Actual Wire mentions still use the bot's qualified identity, irrespective of its display label.

Compose service/project/container/volume identifiers now use `wire-team-bot`. **For an existing
installation, do not simply run the renamed Compose file against empty volumes.** Stop the
old bot and database cleanly, back up configuration/Postgres/crypto state, and copy the stopped
volumes into the new names. Verify their contents before starting the renamed stack with the
same image lineage, credentials and identity. Keep the prior stack and backups available until
hydration, decryption and durable records have been verified. Production migration is an
operator action; the staging migration evidence and exact rollback procedure belong in PLAN.md.

### Model configuration

[.env.example](.env.example) lists the accepted environment keys;
[config.ts](src/app/config.ts) is authoritative for defaults and validation. Configure the chat
endpoint, API key, all six chat model slots and their fallbacks. Models must be available at
your endpoint. The six slots are classification, extraction, summarisation, query analysis,
response generation and complex-answer generation. They can share one model or use different
models; fallbacks are separately configured model names at the same chat endpoint. The client
uses OpenAI-compatible chat completions; API compatibility and answer quality must be checked
with the real-model suite. An API-compatible service is not a guarantee of equivalent behaviour.
The names/defaults in the template are configuration examples, not a live provider model catalogue.

Embeddings can use a separate endpoint or be disabled. For the current acceptance run, set the
embedding mode to `off` in the private environment file before running the commands below.
Disabling embeddings does not disable the chat models. Structured retrieval and model-generated
summaries work without vectors. Semantic retrieval, entity similarity matching and contradiction
detection require a working embedding provider.

The database column is `vector(2560)`. Enabled embeddings and their fallback must produce 2560
finite values; changing an environment setting does not migrate the column. Search is exact
cosine search. Configuration/output checks are implemented; there is no live startup model probe.

An optional local embedding service is available through `npm run staging:up:embeddings`.
Find its container using `docker compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml ps`, then install the
configured model with `docker exec <embedding-container-name> ollama pull <model-name>`.
Set its endpoint and model using the keys in the template.

### Application

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |
| `MESSAGE_BUFFER_SIZE` | `50` | Recent messages kept per conversation for Q&A context (max 500). Does not affect the Tier 2 extraction window, which is always 30. |
| `SECRET_MODE_INACTIVITY_MS` | `1800000` | Milliseconds of inactivity in SECURE mode before Wire Team Bot prompts the team to resume (minimum 60 000) |

### Jira Service Management (optional, customer demo)

Off unless all six required keys are set; a partial configuration stops startup with the names of the missing keys. With it on, `ACT-NNNN to jira` raises a service request for an open action, `ACT-NNNN done` also closes the linked request, and `status of DS-42` or `jira status of ACT-NNNN` reads its status, SLAs and up to three latest service-desk replies. Only replies to the customer are shown; internal agent notes stay in Jira, even though the service account can read them. When the bot is addressed, natural questions such as `@Wire Team Bot what's the status of DS-42?` work too, and general questions point to these commands instead of denying the integration. `reply to DS-42: <text>` or `reply to ACT-NNNN: <text>` sends a customer-facing reply to a linked ticket, marked "Sent from Wire" and without the sender's name. In plain language ("can you raise the proposal in Jira?", "tell the service desk the draft is attached"), the bot asks "Shall I …? Reply yes or no." and acts only on a yes from the same person as their next message. Only the action's description, owner, deadline and ID are sent to Jira. See [PLAN.md §6](PLAN.md#6-customer-demo-jira-service-management-integration) for the design and guardrails.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `WIRE_TEAM_BOT_JIRA_BASE_URL` | required | REST base. Service-account (scoped) tokens must use the API gateway: `https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/<cloudId>` |
| `WIRE_TEAM_BOT_JIRA_SITE_URL` | required | Site used for ticket links, e.g. `https://example.atlassian.net` |
| `WIRE_TEAM_BOT_JIRA_API_TOKEN` | required | Service-account token with `read:servicedesk-request`, `write:servicedesk-request`, `read:jira-work`, `write:jira-work` and `read:jira-user`. The account needs the Agent role in the project |
| `WIRE_TEAM_BOT_JIRA_PROJECT_KEY` | required | The only project the bot reads or writes, e.g. `DS` |
| `WIRE_TEAM_BOT_JIRA_SERVICE_DESK_ID` | required | Numeric service desk ID (`GET /rest/servicedeskapi/servicedesk`) |
| `WIRE_TEAM_BOT_JIRA_REQUEST_TYPE_ID` | required | Numeric request type ID for new requests |
| `WIRE_TEAM_BOT_JIRA_EMAIL` | unset | Set only to use Basic auth with a personal classic token against the site URL, for rehearsal |
| `WIRE_TEAM_BOT_JIRA_TIMEOUT_MS` | `15000` | Per-request timeout (minimum 1000) |
| `WIRE_TEAM_BOT_JIRA_SHARE_WITH_MODEL` | `off` | `on` lets the answer model read live status, SLAs and customer replies of tickets linked from the conversation, so it can answer questions such as "what's the latest on the proposal?" itself. Internal agent notes are never included. **With a remote model provider, this sends ticket content and customer replies to that provider.** Intended for demos; for production, keep it off or use a local model endpoint. See [PLAN.md §6](PLAN.md#6-customer-demo-jira-service-management-integration) |

The due-date field must be on the request's work type; the bot sets it after creating the request. Treat the project's contents as visible to everyone with access to it, and use synthetic data for demos.

---

## Pilot command reference

These examples describe existing command paths; current acceptance status is in [PLAN.md](PLAN.md).
Replace sample references with the IDs returned by your bot. Send one command per message;
multiple requests in one message are not currently supported. Recognised combinations of
explicit commands receive a request to split the message before any command is run.

Record ID prefixes are case-insensitive: `act-0008`, `Act-0008` and `ACT-0008` refer to the
same action. Keep the hyphen and digits unchanged. Replies retain canonical uppercase IDs.
The same rule applies to `DEC-` and `REM-` command references.

Reminder creation, snooze and list replies show the conversation’s configured timezone with
an explicit label (for example, `UTC` or `BST`). UTC is the default; the bot cannot infer the
Wire client’s local timezone. Display formatting does not change the scheduled instant.

| Task | Example |
|---|---|
| Record a decision | `decision: we will use Postgres` |
| Find/list decisions | `decisions about auth`, `list decisions` |
| Correct a decision | `revoke DEC-0001 wrong call`, `decision: use REST supersedes DEC-0001` |
| Record/assign an action | `action: review the contract for Bob` |
| Assign a named task | `@Wire Team Bot @Bob needs to review the checklist by Friday` |
| List work | `my actions`, `team actions`, `overdue actions` |
| Update an action | `ACT-0001 done`, `ACT-0001 reassign to Bob`, `ACT-0001 due Friday` |
| Set a reminder | `remind me in 2 minutes to check the deployment` |
| Manage reminders | `show reminders`, `cancel REM-0001`, `snooze REM-0001 1 hour` |
| Ask/catch up | `@Wire Team Bot what did we decide?`, `@Wire Team Bot catch me up` |
| Inspect channel | `@Wire Team Bot status` |
| Set purpose | `@Wire Team Bot context: This channel coordinates the platform migration` |
| Control listening | `@Wire Team Bot pause`, `@Wire Team Bot secure mode`, `@Wire Team Bot resume` |

Use an actual Wire mention for addressed commands, especially when resuming from PAUSED or
SECURE. Q&A and summaries require a model endpoint. Passive extraction runs in ACTIVE channels.
In SECURE, incoming messages—including `status`—are ignored except a bot-mentioned `resume`.
In PAUSED, other bot-mentioned commands receive a standing-by reply.

Direct command confirmations and answers use Wire’s native reply to identify the source message.
Scheduled notifications remain standalone; self-deleting sources cannot be quoted by Wire.
Passive action capture is quiet but visible: **📝** means at least one action was saved from
that message; **✅** means at least one completion was saved. Both may appear when a message
does both. Reactions follow the record and audit writes; duplicates, rejected captures and
PAUSED/SECURE messages get no success reaction. Use `my actions` or `team actions` to inspect
owners and deadlines. A failed reaction send leaves the saved record intact; reactions are not
retried durably or backfilled onto older messages. Passive decisions do not receive these action
reactions. Explicit commands retain their text confirmations.

Date-only weekdays use noon in the conversation timezone. A weekday matching today stays on
today even after noon; use an explicit time for a later deadline, or `next Friday` for the
following week. Confirmations should be checked against the returned date.

Use text commands for corrections. Supported text commands also accept a leading single-line inline-code span
around the command prefix or whole command when pasted from an example. This includes
reminders, decisions, actions and addressed privacy controls; code blocks and prose examples
are not treated as direct commands. Actual person mentions carry their qualified user identity through action creation and
reassignment, with membership checked in this conversation. Plain-text assignees require an
unambiguous full name or handle. The addressed named-task variant also accepts `@Bob really needs to …`.
Decision button offers have been removed; clicks on old buttons give text guidance. Mention the bot with `resume` while paused or secure. Existing deployments must migrate their model environment keys and Compose resources using the upgrade guidance above.

## Development

```bash
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm rebuild prisma @prisma/client @prisma/engines
npx prisma generate
cp .env.example .env          # fill in the Wire app token, app ID and crypto key
npx prisma migrate deploy     # apply existing migrations to your isolated local DB
npm run dev                   # start with ts-node

npm test                      # run unit + contract tests (Vitest)
npx tsc --noEmit              # type-check
npm run lint                  # lint source and tests

npm run build && npm run test:e2e            # answer judging + exact stored-fact checks
npm run test:e2e -- --filter TC-DEC         # run a subset of scenarios
npm run test:acceptance                     # fixed 20-event stored-record sample + 10 known questions
npm run build && npm run simulate           # multi-day replay — stored-record inventory
npm run simulate:review                     # human source/fact review, including missed captures
```

Database migrations live in `prisma/migrations/`. The schema is in `prisma/schema.prisma`.

### Dependency notes

- **Runtime requirement.** `@wireapp/wire-apps-js-sdk` pulls in `@wireapp/core-crypto`, whose native library needs
  glibc 2.38+ on linux/x86_64 (or macOS). Importing the SDK on an older glibc (for example Ubuntu 22.04 / WSL) fails at
  load time, which also breaks `npm test` and the CLI/e2e harness locally. Run them in a container instead:

  ```bash
  docker run --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -e npm_config_cache=/tmp/npm-cache -v "$PWD":/app -w /app node:22-trixie-slim npx vitest run
  ```

- **`npm install` on npm 10.9.x** fails with `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'edgesOut')` while resolving
  this tree. Use `npm ci` with the committed lockfile, and the install sequence above. Dependency changes are outside the current QA scope.
- **`npm ci` compiles better-sqlite3 unnecessarily** on npm 10 (it ignores the package's `gypfile: false` when
  reading from the lockfile). The Dockerfile and CI therefore run
  `npm ci --ignore-scripts` followed by `npm rebuild prisma @prisma/client @prisma/engines`;
  the Dockerfile also uses `--no-audit` to separate auditing from the build. Prisma is the only dependency whose
  install hooks are needed. On a machine with a C++ toolchain, plain `npm ci` also works, just slower.

### Test layout

| Directory | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `tests/usecases/` | Unit tests for use cases — fully mocked, no DB/network |
| `tests/pipeline/` | Unit tests for pipeline adapters (classifier, extractor, summariser, query analyser) |
| `tests/retrieval/` | Unit tests for retrieval paths and engine |
| `tests/contract/` | `WireEventRouter` routing contract — mocked use cases, real router |
| `tests/integration/` | Real Postgres + pgvector (requires `INTEGRATION_TESTS=1`) |

### Key files for orientation

| File | Role |

## Official SDK cutover

This runbook is for deployments still using the old fork/user-account bot. See
[PLAN.md](PLAN.md) for recorded staging results and cutover status. Do not recreate storage
on ordinary restarts.

1. Record the old image tag and configuration, and list existing channels:
   `SELECT channel_id, channel_name FROM channel_config;`.
2. Stop the old stack. Back up Postgres, the old crypto volume and configuration. Preserve
   them for rollback; the old fork's SQLite/MLS state is incompatible with the new app identity.
3. Register the new application with a team admin using the steps above. Deploy a pinned image
   with the new app configuration and a **fresh, separate** crypto volume. Keep the existing
   Postgres data; review any image migrations before startup.
4. Start and check migrations, CoreCrypto initialisation and connection. An empty member cache
   is expected for an app that has not joined any conversations yet.
5. Have the team admin add the new app to the intended channels. Verify decisions, Q&A and a
   short reminder. Check member names and channel state.
6. Restart, send another message and confirm it decrypts. Test a reminder due across restart.
   Check 1:1 behaviour separately; do not assume org-wide personal retrieval is supported.
7. Record results against the pilot gates in PLAN.md. Roll back if necessary using the old
   image, configuration and backed-up crypto volume; restore Postgres if migrations require it.

Keep the token, crypto key and volume together as the application's identity state. A token
refresh changes the token only. Removing a volume or regenerating the key is not a refresh.

## Release-candidate acceptance

Staging runs the post-release reviewed image `wire-team-bot:staging-pr-review-d59b444`, with its
existing database and crypto identity preserved and verified backups available. See
[PLAN.md](PLAN.md#post-release-staging-activation) for activation evidence and rollback.
The reviewed source passed 64/64 real-model scenarios, 18 mandatory stored/state checks and
403 unit/contract/isolated DB tests, plus build, type-check and lint. The final status-label edit
was followed by a fresh build and full test run; the model suite preceded that wording edit.
The earlier 20/20 stored-fact sample belongs to the pre-PR candidate. A fresh Wire `status`
round trip on this image and detailed human quality approval remain pending. The earlier
timezone Wire retest remains recorded evidence on its original image.
The earlier [manual QA packet](PLAN.md#final-manual-qa-on-the-pinned-staging-candidate)
and [readable synthetic quality evidence](tests/acceptance/qa6-quality-review.md) remain available.
Current activation and rollback details are in [PLAN.md](PLAN.md#post-release-staging-activation).
The [automated QA sequence](PLAN.md#automated-qa-before-final-manual-acceptance) fixes the known
failures, reruns stored-record evaluation, packages one candidate and prepares the final manual
QA session. No new features or legacy branch imports are part of that sequence.

Use synthetic data in a separate database. The development run used Postgres 16 + pgvector,
`node:22-trixie-slim`, and the existing staging provider settings. Embeddings were explicitly
off for model journeys. The database/vector adapter was checked separately with 2560-dimensional
synthetic vectors. No running staging or production service needs to be stopped for these tests.

```bash
# Create once; this is a new, disposable acceptance database, not the team database.
docker run -d --name wire-team-bot-v3-test-db \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=wirebot -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=synthetic-only \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=wire_team_bot_test -p 127.0.0.1:55439:5432 pgvector/pgvector:pg16

# Run from the checkout, with approved model settings already in .env.staging.
# For acceptance, add the calibrated judge override from PLAN.md to docker run.
# This shell is only the test container; CLI/evaluation never connects to Wire.
docker run --rm -it --network host --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  --env-file .env.staging -e npm_config_cache=/tmp/npm-cache \
  -e DATABASE_URL=postgresql://wirebot:synthetic-only@127.0.0.1:55439/wire_team_bot_test \
  -v "$PWD":/app -w /app node:22-trixie-slim bash

# Inside that container:
npx prisma migrate deploy
npm run build
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run lint
INTEGRATION_TESTS=1 npm test
npm run test:e2e -- --json
EVALUATION_COMMIT=<tested-commit> npm run test:acceptance
EVALUATION_COMMIT=<tested-commit> npm run simulate
npm run simulate:review
```

`--network host` is for this Linux test environment. Do not point these commands at a shared
team database. The test harness uses isolated conversation IDs and only removes rows owned by
its integration fixtures. No reset command is required. The e2e and simulation scripts use the
already installed `ts-node`; they do not download an unpinned runner.

To repeat the reaction lifecycle check in that isolated test container:

```bash
EVALUATION_COMMIT=<tested-commit> \
EVALUATION_FIXTURE=tests/acceptance/reaction-fixture.json \
EVALUATION_REPORT=tests/acceptance/reaction-report.json npm run test:acceptance
```

Check the report's separate `reactions` arrays against source events: 📝 for `reaction-create`,
✅ for `reaction-complete`, and none for explicit creation or ordinary chat. Inspect stored
records after drain: the checklist belongs to Bob and is done; the explicit report belongs to
Carol and stays open. Verify the corresponding action audits as well. Reactions are not capture
scores; the evaluator still matches every stored record against expected facts/source events.
Actual Wire client display requires a new unmentioned commitment and completion in the test
conversation; existing records do not receive retroactive reactions.

The original `e35428b` baseline was built in a separate archived checkout with CLI instrumentation.
Original baseline tooling and unmodified report text remain in the pre-cleanup Git snapshot
`f0879c0`. To reproduce that historical run, use its tooling and configuration contract, together
with [the commit mapping](tests/acceptance/history-map.json), in a separate checkout and isolated
DB. The historical patch can be recovered with
`git show f0879c0:tests/acceptance/baseline-cli.patch > /tmp/baseline-cli.patch`.
Current tracked historical reports have branding normalised and carry an explicit annotation;
this does not represent rerunning their tests or changing their recorded pass/fail results.

Before an acceptance run, use the calibrated judge model and environment override recorded in
[PLAN.md](PLAN.md#automated-qa-before-final-manual-acceptance). The application model slots stay
unchanged. Check the judge against both correct and deliberately wrong answers:

```bash
node node_modules/ts-node/dist/bin.js --transpile-only tests/e2e/calibrateJudge.ts
```

The e2e report retains source events, scenario time/timezone, all stored records after process
exit, exact stored-fact failures and every model verdict. Fixed command responses use exact text
assertions where configured. Generated IDs support follow-up commands; stored-fact checks match
content, source events, qualified identities, status and dates. An unconfigured stored check is
reported as unreviewed, not passed. A model PASS cannot override a failing deterministic check.

The fixed sample is [capture-fixture.json](tests/acceptance/capture-fixture.json). Compare
[baseline-report.json](tests/acceptance/baseline-report.json) and
[candidate-report.json](tests/acceptance/candidate-report.json), including every record and
question answer. Records match by expected fact, source event and owner; generated record IDs
are not scoring keys. Precision counts duplicate/wrong captures in its denominator, and recall
counts all expected events. The report includes marker occurrences in stored records and
stderr, elapsed event times, failures and unsolicited-message counts. Times include processing
and queue drain; they are not a first-token benchmark. Current fixtures use the canonical bot name; historical report text is explicitly normalised
for branding, with original evidence retained in Git.

Simulation inventory is written to `tests/simulation/simulation-report.json`; it is synthetic,
local and gitignored. Its `expected: 0` means **unreviewed**, not perfect recall. Review the actual
source events and stored content with `simulate:review`, record misses as well as false positives,
and put the reviewer/date and decision in PLAN.md. `golden.json` must not be presented as approved
while it only contains instructions. Human review of the fixed sample and ten known answers is
also required before the pilot.

Build a pinned candidate from the tested checkout, then exercise its CLI against the isolated
DB using `--entrypoint node <image> dist/app/cli.js`. The normal entrypoint starts the Wire bot;
only use it when the operator is ready for the designated Wire test.

```bash
docker build --label org.opencontainers.image.revision=<tested-commit> \
  -t wire-team-bot:v3-rc-<tested-commit> .
```

To run the unchanged e2e suite against that image's compiled runtime, mount only the test harness
and its development tooling. Keep `/app/dist` and `/app/node_modules` from the image.
For acceptance, add the calibrated judge override from PLAN.md to this command:

```bash
docker run --rm --network host --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  --env-file .env.staging \
  -e DATABASE_URL=postgresql://wirebot:synthetic-only@127.0.0.1:55439/wire_team_bot_test \
  -e NODE_PATH=/validation/node_modules \
  -v "$PWD/tests":/app/tests:ro \
  -v "$PWD/node_modules":/validation/node_modules:ro \
  -v "$PWD/tsconfig.json":/validation/tsconfig.json:ro \
  --entrypoint node wire-team-bot:v3-rc-2dbc0fd \
  /validation/node_modules/ts-node/dist/bin.js --transpile-only \
  --project /validation/tsconfig.json /app/tests/e2e/runner.ts --json
```

The `.dockerignore` excludes secrets, crypto storage, tests, local dependencies and Git metadata
from the image context. Preserve the existing crypto key/store when testing restart. Delivery is
at least once: a crash after a successful reminder send but before the database update can cause
a repeat. The in-memory capture queue is intentionally transient and loses unfinished work on
restart. Arbitrary edited messages do not update records; use the documented correction commands.

## Designated Wire smoke test

Record the qualified test conversation (`ID@domain`), operator, second named member, approved
provider settings and human reviewer in PLAN.md. A conversation name is sufficient to begin:
the operator can supply its name, and the bot’s local SDK store can resolve its ID if it has joined. Do not use a real team channel
until the synthetic privacy/access checks have passed. Use actual Wire mentions below; plain text
that looks like a mention is not sufficient for resume from PAUSED/SECURE.

1. Start the pinned candidate with the designated staging identity and persistent crypto store.
   Record image digest, commit, provider model names, embedding mode and the test conversation in
   PLAN.md; never copy tokens or keys. Verify the registered app display name is **Wire Team Bot**.
2. In the designated channel, send `decision: use Postgres for the pilot ledger because transactions
   are required`. Save its `DEC-` reference. Mention the bot and ask what was decided and why.
   Record a replacement with `decision: use Postgres 16 supersedes DEC-…` using that active
   decision as the target. Revoke the replacement using its new ID, and check both records and
   audit entries.
3. Send `action: <member> to review the pilot checklist by Friday`. Verify the stored owner ID,
   display name and deadline, list it, reassign it, change its deadline and mark it done. Repeat
   an unknown and an ambiguous name: no guessed owner should be written. Restart and verify names
   still resolve on the first subsequent message.
4. Create a short reminder, cancel another, and snooze a third. Restart before one is due; stop the
   candidate until another is overdue and start it again. Confirm delivery and durable status.
   Failed-send recovery is covered by injected-failure DB tests; if an operator reproduces a real
   transport interruption, verify pending state and a later retry, allowing duplicate delivery.
5. Send an ambient commitment and verify the silent stored action once processing finishes. Send
   its completion as the owner and verify status becomes done. Check that explicit commands were
   not also captured by the passive pipeline. Inspect catch-up output and open/overdue lists.
6. Start a slow synthetic extraction, then mention `pause` or `secure mode`. Wait for confirmation;
   send a unique excluded marker, restart, send a second excluded marker, then mention `resume`.
   Ask a new question and inspect both model diagnostics and channel records: neither excluded
   marker may appear. Repeat for both states. A failed state-persistence warning is a failed check,
   not permission to restart under an assumed durable pause.
7. In a second designated test channel, try the first channel’s record IDs for recall and changes;
   they must not expose or alter those records. Domain-collision denial is covered by automated
   negative tests; exercise federation manually if that is part of this pilot deployment.
8. Confirm reconnect/decryption after restart, text corrections, no required inert buttons, and
   no fabricated successful write from a Q&A follow-up. Record actual outputs and pass/fail in
   PLAN.md. Then obtain human approval of at least 20 capture events and 8/10 useful answers.

Begin the five-working-day P3 pilot only after the unresolved acceptance items in PLAN.md are
closed. Use a short feedback log for saved effort, errors, latency and noise, then choose keep,
fix or stop. Production deployment remains a separate operator action.
